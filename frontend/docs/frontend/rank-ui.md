# Rank UI Feature Documentation

This document details the implementation of the user interface for displaying ranked applicants in the Scholarship Selector frontend application.

## Components Implemented/Modified:

- `rank.js` (page): This page now displays a list of ranked applicants.
- `ApplicantCard.js` (component): This component was updated to display the details of a single applicant, including their name, email, GPA, experience, skills, and a calculated score.

## Implementation Details:

1.  **`rank.js` Page Update:**
    - The `rank.js` page was updated to fetch and display a list of applicants.
    - For now, dummy data is used to simulate the ranked applicants. This will be replaced with actual data from the backend API in a future feature.
    - The page conditionally renders a message if no applicants are available.

2.  **`ApplicantCard.js` Enhancement:**
    - The placeholder `ApplicantCard.js` was updated to receive an `applicant` prop.
    - It now displays the applicant's name, email, GPA, years of experience, skills, and their calculated score.
    - Basic Tailwind CSS classes were applied for styling the card, including a circular initial for the applicant's name.

3.  **Data Display:**
    - The `rank.js` page maps through the `rankedApplicants` array and renders an `ApplicantCard` for each applicant.
    - The list is styled with basic spacing using Tailwind CSS.

## Usage:

Users can navigate to the `/rank` page to view the list of applicants, ordered by their ranking score. This UI provides a clear and organized way to present the ranking results.
